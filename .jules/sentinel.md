## 2024-05-10 - Disable Application Backup
**Vulnerability:** Android application backup enabled by default.
**Learning:** `android:allowBackup="true"` allows users to use `adb backup` to extract application data, potentially leading to unauthorized data extraction if sensitive data is stored.
**Prevention:** Set `android:allowBackup="false"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` unless explicitly required and carefully managed.
